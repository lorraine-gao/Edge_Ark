## üóÑÔ∏è Database

This project uses **MongoDB Atlas**, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database, to store uploaded fixture data.

- When a user uploads a CSV file, the data is processed and stored in a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
- Database credentials are securely managed via environment variables and not exposed in the codebase.
- Remote database access is enabled through IP allowlisting and proper user role configuration.
